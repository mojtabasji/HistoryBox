## üéØ Project Goals

The History Box project aims to create a digital memory-keeping platform where users can:
- Document personal memories with photos and descriptions
- Associate memories with specific geographic locations
- Store data securely in a PostgreSQL database
- View memories on an interactive map interface
- Securely authenticate and manage their personal content
- Upload and optimize images automatically
- Enable real-time updates and synchronization

This technology stack provides a modern, scalable, and secure foundation for building a feature-rich memory management application with robust data persistence and real-time capabilities.
