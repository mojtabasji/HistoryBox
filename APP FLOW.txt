🌍 For non-registered users (new visitors):

First thing they should see:
A world map with locked regions + counters → this creates curiosity.
Example: “There are 18 hidden photos in Tehran” (but blurred/locked).

CTA options on first page:

🔓 Unlock this region → prompts login + payment.

📝 Sign up to contribute → clear button.

👀 Maybe allow 1 free teaser photo per region to spark curiosity.

⚠️ If you show the login page first, many users will bounce. Instead, tease the content → then funnel them into login.

👤 For logged-in users:

First page should also be the map (same experience).

But unlocked regions show real photos (grid or pop-up).

They get extra options:

➕ Post a photo (upload + caption + location).

⭐ See their profile + contributed posts.

💳 Manage unlocks/payments.

✅ Suggested Flow

Visitor opens site → sees map with curiosity counters.

Click on a locked region → modal appears: “This region has 12 hidden photos. Unlock to see them.”

Button: Unlock Now (login required) → goes to signup/login.

After login:

If region is paid → show payment flow.

If already unlocked → show full gallery.

Logged-in users can also:

Post their own photo.

See their unlocked history.

📌 In one line:
👉 Always start with the map for everyone. Use curiosity (locked photos + counts) to drive them into login and payments.
