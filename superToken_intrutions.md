Thanks! I’ll find the correct way to access SuperTokens session and user info on the server side using the App Router in Next.js 15.5.3 with supertokens-node v9.2.3 and supertokens-auth-react v0.50.0. I’ll also check why the `supertokens-node/recipe/session/framework/nextjs` import may not be available and what the correct method is for this version.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the working integration details.
